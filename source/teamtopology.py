def findTopology(teamflow, classifiers=False, centralities=False, extended=True):
    """ Team Topology Finder - performs team topology analysis from flow of value between teams
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    teamflow : dictionary
        desciption of value flow between teams in the form:

        {'teamA': ['teamB','teamC'],
         'teamB': [],
         'teamC': ['TeamB']}

        in the above example: teamA gets value from teamB and teamC
                              teamB gets no value from the other teams (must be included)
                              teamC gets value only from teamC

    classifiers : True/False
        include classifier values in the output
    
    centralities: True/False
        include centrality scores for betweenness and page rank in the output

    extended: True/False
        perform extended checks for classifications of SA and EN teams by final examination of vertex degree (inbound/outbound edges)

    Returns
    -------
    dictionary
        a dictionary containing the team topology analysis in the form:

        {'team_1':  [<betweenness>, <pageRank>, <betweenness_classifier>, <pageRank_classifier>, 'team_type'],
          ...,
         'team_n':  [<betweenness>, <pageRank>, <betweenness_classifier>, <pageRank_classifier>, 'team_type']}

        Notes:
            betweenness and pageRank (optional) are floating point numbers
            classifiers (optional) are 0 or 1
            team_type is one of: SA, EN, CS or PF.
